Aragon Desktop is an Electron app that runs the Aragon client in a fully decentralized way.

It queries the Ethereum blockchain for the latest version of the app, and then serves it over a local IPFS node.

## Running locally

› git clone git@github.com:aragon/aragon-desktop
› npm i
› npm start
```
